What is HTML ?
=============

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is one of the original languages of the web. HTML contains a set of elements that create the structure of a web page. We need HTML because it provides the support and structure for your web page.

Elements and Tags
----------------

HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. HTML tags are used to markup the page so the web browser knows how to format and structure the text layout.

With this minor adjustment, the web browser knows how the page should be formatted. The HTML Elements can use :

* <h1> - represents a header or title
* <p> - represents a paragraph of text
* <div> - represents a division
    the <div> has an attribute (align) that moves its positioning to the right of the page.

Each HTML element has its own set of characteristics that are applied to the formatting of the web page. For example, the <h1> element increased the text size and adjusted the font weight to bold and the <p> element added a line breaks and grouped text together.

To apply an element, you need to use "tags". The general syntax of an HTML tag is:

<TAG> TEXT </TAG>

Tags are the building blocks or lego pieces you add to your web page to build the structure and layout.

ANATOMY OF AN HTML ELEMENT:
--------------------------

An element is an individual component of HTML such as paragraphs, headings, tables, lists, links, images, etc.

A tag marks the beginning and end of an element in your document (web page) and contains characters that indicate the purpose of the tag.

ESSENTIAL TAGS OVERVIEW:
--------------------------

Here are some of the most commonly used HTML tags:

*Section Headings - `<h1>` - `<h6>`
The *HTML <h1>â€“<h6> elements* represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.

*Paragraph
    *Tag: `<p> Hello World </p>`
    *Creates and separates a block of text from its surrounding elements with a blank space
    *Paragraphs are block-level elements (we'll take a look at block vs inline elements soon)

*Anchor
    *Tag: `<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a'> This is a Hyperlink </a>`
    *The Anchor element or `<a></a>`tag creates a hyperlink
    *`href` is an attribute. An attribute provides extra configuration details or adds behavior to an element. `href` holds the reference to the link the user will be redirected to when clicked.

*Content Division
    *Tag: `
    content
    *The `div` element is a flexibile container commonly used to group related elements with one another.
